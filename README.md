# OOP-LAB-0
For Task 1, I already had macOS on my MacBook
For Task 2, you can see in the first screenshot, I have everything installed: zsh, oh-my-zsh, Git, gcc. I use Visual Studio Code.
For Task 3, you can see in the second screenshot, I created a repository in the file OOP, added hellow.c, commited it with the tag "Hellow World", prepared to push it to the OOP repository, then pushed it as the branch master. Then I compiled the program and executed it.
